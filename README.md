# Brain Tumor Classification with Keras and Hyperparameter Tuning

# Overview
This repository contains a Python script for classifying brain scan images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary. The classification is done using a Keras model based on the VGG16 architecture and hyperparameter optimization is achieved using Keras Tuner.

# Dataset
The dataset comprises approximately 7000 brain scan images.
Class Labels:
Glioma
Meningioma
No Tumor
Pituitary
